	//	Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range[0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.



	//Example 1:

	//Input: nums = [3, 0, 1]
	//Output: 2
	//Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
