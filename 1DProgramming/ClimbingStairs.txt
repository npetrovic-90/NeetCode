	//You are climbing a staircase.It takes n steps to reach the top.

	//Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps.In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?



	//Example 1:


	//Input: n = 2
	//Output: 2
	//Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
	//1. 1 step + 1 step
	//2. 2 steps
	class Problem

		//Solution
		//iterate through array of numbers, count them and add them to hashmap
		//create new array that has same length as original array and add elements from hashmap to that array
		//where number of apperances of each number will be value of new array member
